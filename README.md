# Build Python Web Apps with Django

Hello! This GitHub repo was forked from Codecademy's GitHub repo, in order to learn how to deploy an app with PythonAnywhere, as part of the Codecademy "Build Python Web Apps With Django Skills Path" course.

The app is a Vet's Office portal (built throughout the skill path), that allows a logged in user to create, read, update and delete owners, pets, and appointments associated with the Vet's Office. I made some additional changes after forking the repo, including adding the fuctionality to be able to logout of the application, and adding a nav bar to the base template, to show a 'Logout' button (when an authenticated user is logged in), and Login and Signup buttons when a user is not logged in.

The app is deployed here: https://katiebickford1.pythonanywhere.com/
